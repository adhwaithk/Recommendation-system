Movie Recommendation System
-------------------------------------

The Movie Recommendation System is a content-based filtering application built to recommend films based on their textual similarities. It utilizes technologies 
such as NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, PorterStemmer, CountVectorizer, and Streamlit to achieve comprehensive functionality and provide an intuitive user experience.

Features
-------------------------------------

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on textual similarities between movie descriptions.
Efficient Data Manipulation: Utilizes NumPy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Text Processing: Utilizes NLTK with PorterStemmer for enhanced text processing capabilities.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes CountVectorizer for feature extraction, enabling content-based filtering.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed using Streamlit, providing a seamless interaction and visualization of recommendations.

Application Flow
-------------------------------------

User Input: Users provide input, such as their preferences or movie titles.
Text Processing: Movie descriptions are processed using NLTK with PorterStemmer to extract relevant features.
Feature Extraction: Features are extracted using CountVectorizer for content-based filtering.
Recommendation Generation: Based on the extracted features, the system recommends movies with similar characteristics.
User Interaction: Users interact with the Streamlit interface to view recommendations and explore movie details.

Technologies Used
--------------------------------------

NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For natural language processing tasks.
PorterStemmer: For stemming words to their root form.
CountVectorizer: For feature extraction from textual data.
Streamlit: For developing a user-friendly web application interface.

Installation
